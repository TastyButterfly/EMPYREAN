                    focusing on stealth and parkour. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, assigning the player to complete an 
                    assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out 
                    the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a leap of faith into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden 
                    across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the 
                    rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control 
                    of the modern-day character who, by nature of the Animus use, has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, 
                    as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe, and assassination targets by illuminating people 
                    in different colors.<br>
                    <br>The games use the concept of active versus passive moves, with active moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, 
                    or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must 
                    either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' 
                    alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade 
                    set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, which can be used to perform surreptitious assassinations.</p>
