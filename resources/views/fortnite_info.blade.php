                    Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode 
                    versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle 
                    royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative 
                    hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend 
                    objects with traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom 
                    to create worlds and battle arenas.<br><br>
                    <h3>GAME MODES</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i><b>Fortnite: Save the World</b></i> is a player-versus-environment cooperative game, with four players collaborating towards 
                            a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of 
                            the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like "husks". The players take the role 
                            of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps 
                            to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of 
                            in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be 
                            leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.</li><br>
                        <li>
                            <i><b>Fortnite Battle Royale</b></i> is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, 
                            or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that 
                            crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while 
                            trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the 
                            map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be 
                            eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages 
                            player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.
