    <ul class="details">
      <li>Turn off analytic data sharing.</li>
      <p class="details">We analyze your behavior and the games you play to further improve our service. We also analyze your system to get
        a better picture of the type of hardware our users use. We collect information about the duration and the games that you play to be
        added into our databases. They provide us valuable information about what games are popular and what are not. They will also be published
        on our leaderboards. You have the option to opt-out of these features.
      </p>
      <li>Turn off personalized ad settings.</li>
      <p class="details">Based on the genre of games you play and your interactions with other people, we generate personalized advertising that
        we guess you might like to further improve your ad experience. Please note that by turning this feature off, you will still receive ads
        wherever applicable and the same frequency had you turned it on. However, the ads may not be as accurate and may not reflect your personal
        interests. Nevertheless, we provide you the option to opt-out of these features.
      </p>
      <li>Turn off performance tracking</li>
      <p class="details">We also collect information about your system's performance like for example, latency, client FPS, and RAM usage.
        These information will be used to revise our system requirements from time-to-time to better reflect real world conditions and to
        accommodate a wider range of users by providing guidelines for multiple platforms. For example, for Nvidia and AMD GPUs. We assure you
        that these trackers will take up no more than 25MB of RAM and 5% of CPU usage, they will only have a negligible impact on network
        performance (around 20Kbps). However, if maximum performance or privacy is your priority, you can opt-out of these trackers.

    <h1 class="details">At EMPYREAN inc., we strive for consumer rights.<br>We provide flexible and reasonable pricing, always.</h1>
    <h2 class="details" id="refund">1. Refund Policy</h2><p class="details">
      While we always try to side with our customers, it is of the greatest regret that we are unable to provide refunds. Hence there is <b>no way</b> to cancel your plans. However, we do provide a fair and dynamic way to upgrade or downgrade your existing plan, as per section (2). Temporarily, we do not have the infrastructure to support refunds within our payment gateway API. Owing to the fact that our products are still very new and lots of work still needs to be done before a mature system can be established. We are actively working on it and we hope to provide refunds in the future through a server update. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
    </p>
    <h2 class="details">2. Upgrade/Downgrade Policy</h2><p class="details">
      You can upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan at any time. The changes will take effect immediately. If you upgrade or even downgrade, you will be charged the difference in price between the two plans. The difference is calculated in days, which excludes today, meaning that it starts counting from tomorrow, multiplied by the rate of charge per days of our annual plans (assuming 365 days). For example, our yearly basic plan is RM200.00. Assume you have 73 days left in your plan, you will be discounted RM40.00 (RM200.00*73/365). However, if you buy a different item that costs less, like the PC Game Monthly Pass, which costs RM35.00, you will end up with a total of -RM5.00. This difference will <b>not</b> be refunded to you, as per section (1). As controversial as this may be, it will be revised in the future once we are able to provide refunds. In the meantime, you are advised to upgrade to another yearly plan (if applicable); or wait for the plan to be exhausted further before switching to another plan.</p>
    <h2 class="details">3. Extension Policy</h2><p class="details">
      You may extend your current plan at any time. This is done by buying a monthly or yearly pass of the same level. The extension will begin at the day your current plan ends, and end the next day of the next month or year the day your current plan ends, provided you bought a monthly or yearly plan, respectively. The prices is as listed and will not be different even if you have an active plan. Thus, it is advised you buy a yearly pass to maximize your savings.
    </p><h2 class="details">4. Free Day Policy and 'End On' Terminology</h2><p class="details">
      Each subscription plan comes with a free day, which is the day you start your subscription. This day is also an added bonus if you decide to extend your policy. Only a free day is given regardless of a monthly or annual plan, though do note that annual plans still provide more value for money.<br><br>
      'End On' or 'Expires On' or 'Ends', with or without capitalization, refers to the day your subscription ends. Specifically, you will lose access to our services during midnight of the day your services ends. The change may take up to 15 minutes to take effect. For example, if your profile states 'Expires on 2 Jan 2025', your services will be terminated on the 2nd of January 2025, at 00:00:00, up to 00:00:15. You will not be able to access our services after this time, and will be given a 15 minute grace period to end your gaming session. You will be notified through the client app when this grace period starts. You are advised to renew your subscription before this time to avoid any inconvenience.
