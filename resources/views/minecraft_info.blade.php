                     <h3>GAME MODES</h3><br>
                     <b>Survival mode</b><br>
                     In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to 
                     craft certain blocks and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius 
                     of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night. The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by 
                     attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a 
                     hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game (except in peaceful difficulty). If the 
                     hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players 
                     have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.<br><br>
                     <b>Creative mode</b><br>
                     In creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can 
                     place or remove them instantly. Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their 
                     characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger. The game mode helps players focus on building 
                     and creating projects of any size without disturbance.
