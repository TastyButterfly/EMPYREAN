                <p style="margin-top: 10px;;">Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, 
                    characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either 
                    the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, 
                    as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each 
                    round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased 
                    using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible 
                    for, and any objectives completed. <br><br>
                    
                    <b>YOUR AGENTS</b><br>
                    More than guns and bullets, youâ€™ll choose an Agent armed with adaptive, swift, and lethal abilities that create opportunities to 
                    let your gunplay shine. No two Agents play alike, just as no two highlight reels will look the same.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>YOUR MAPS</b><br>
                    FIGHT AROUND THE WORLD.<br>
                    Each map is a playground to showcase your creative thinking. Purpose-built for team strategies, spectacular plays, and clutch 
                    moments. Make the play others will imitate for years to come.</p>
